# Health Insurance Cross-Sell

# 1. About the Business

Our client is a well-established insurance company specializing in providing comprehensive health insurance coverage to its customers. Over the years, the company has built a strong reputation for reliability and customer satisfaction in the health insurance sector.

Now, our client is expanding its offerings to include vehicle insurance and seeks assistance in strategizing this expansion. Specifically, they aim to leverage their existing customer base and predict whether policyholders from the past year would also be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance provided by the company.

This initiative aligns with the company's goal of enhancing its portfolio of insurance products and providing a one-stop solution for its customers' insurance needs. By accurately predicting customer interest in vehicle insurance, our client aims to optimize marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and ultimately drive growth in their vehicle insurance segment.

# 1.1. Business Problem

The business problem consists of developing a predictive model capable of determining whether a potential customer is inclined to purchase vehicle insurance. 

This is crucial for insurance companies as it allows them to target their marketing efforts more effectively, identifying the customers most likely to convert and adapting their sales strategies accordingly. By accurately predicting customer interest in vehicle insurance, companies can save valuable resources and increase their conversion rates, resulting in an overall increase in business efficiency and profitability.

# 3. Solution Strategy

To tackle this challenge, my strategy was to employ machine learning techniques to rank a potential client list based on propensity scores. The project was divided into the following steps:

- Data Extraction and Preprocessing: In this stage, we will use Kaggle and libraries such as Pandas and NumPy in Python to collect and prepare the data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Different hypotheses will be created, validated, or rejected. Insights will be generated through the understanding of the data.

- Machine Learning Models: Some models will be trained and evaluated according to appropriate metrics.

- Model Testing: The best model will be tested on a new dataset.

- Hyperparameter Optimization: The best model will have its hyperparameters adjusted.

- Deployment: The final model will be deployed in a production environment for ongoing use.

# 4. Lessons Learned

- Despite applying techniques such as ensemble learning and grid search, we were unable to enhance the model to achieve a balance between increased accuracy and model speed. In fact, in some cases, there was a decline in performance.
